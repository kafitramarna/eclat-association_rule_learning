# eclat-association_rule_learning

## Description
This project implements Market Basket Analysis using the Eclat algorithm to find frequent itemsets in transaction data. Unlike the Apriori algorithm, Eclat focuses on identifying itemsets that frequently occur together, without generating association rules.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv`, which contains transaction data where each row represents a transaction with items purchased.

## Languages or Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Libraries
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `apyori` (used for simplicity, though Eclat is conceptually different)
